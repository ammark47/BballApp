# Radium Changelog

## 0.15.3 (November 16, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `"files"` section in `package.json`, should fix `npm install issues`

## 0.15.2 (November 15, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- IE vender prefix (ms) is now converted to dash-case correctly (-ms), thanks @PallasKatze, fixes #413
- Super getChildContext is no longer ignored, thanks @richardfickling, fixes #412
- Update to inline-style-prefixer v0.5.1 and changed the userAgent error to a console.warning

## 0.15.1 (November 11, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix bug where active styles on multiple elements in the same component were not being removed on mouse up, fixes #410

## 0.15.0 (November 11, 2015)

### New Features

- Radium now uses [inline-style-prefixer](https://github.com/rofrischmann/inline-style-prefixer) to do all prefixing. Because `inline-style-prefixer` relies on the userAgent (similar to autoprefixer), it produces the same prefixes on both the client and the server. This is a huge step in making Radium truly universal (see [example](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/examples/server.js)). Thanks much to @rofrischmann for putting up with my API suggestions and requests!
- Any Radium component can also be configured at render time via a [`radiumConfig`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/docs/api/README.md#radium). This was mainly required for passing the `userAgent` during a server-side render.

### Breaking Changes

- Style component no longer supports the `prefix` prop. It automatically gets the correct userAgent to pass to the prefixer from `radiumConfig` context

### Bug Fixes

- Radium wrapper now replaces the `style` propType, if defined, with array or object, fixing #396
- Stateless components now support context, thanks @ThomWright
- Static fields on stateless components are now transferred to the Radium wrapper (`defualtProps`, `propTypes`, etc)

### Improvements

- Code has been ES2015-ified: const and let, import/export, fat arrows,
- Code has moved from `modules` to `src`

## 0.14.3 (October 19, 2015)
