# Dynamics.js
Dynamics.js is a JavaScript library to create physics-based animations

To see some demos, check out [dynamicsjs.com](http://dynamicsjs.com).

## Usage
Download:
- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/michaelvillar/dynamics.js/releases)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamics.js): `npm install dynamics.js`
- bower: `bower install dynamics.js`

Include `dynamics.js` into your page:
```html
<script src="dynamics.js"></script>
```
You can animate CSS properties of any DOM element.
```javascript
var el = document.getElementById("logo")
dynamics.animate(el, {
  translateX: 350,
  scale: 2,
  opacity: 0.5
}, {
  type: dynamics.spring,
  frequency: 200,
  friction: 200,
  duration: 1500
})
```

You also can animate SVG properties.
```javascript
var path = document.querySelector("path")
dynamics.animate(path, {
  d: "M0,0 L0,100 L100,50 L0,0 Z",
  fill: "#FF0000",
  rotateZ: 45,
  // rotateCX and rotateCY are the center of the rotation
  rotateCX: 100,
  rotateCY: 100
}, {
  friction: 800
})
```

And any JavaScript object.
```javascript
var o = {
  number: 10,
  color: "#FFFFFF",
  string: "10deg",
  array: [ 1, 10 ]
}
dynamics.animate(o, {
  number: 20,
  color: "#000000",
  string: "90deg",
  array: [-9, 99 ]
})
```

## Reference
### dynamics.animate(el, properties, options)
Animates an element to the properties with the animation options.
- `el` is a DOM element, a JavaScript object or an Array of elements
- `properties` is an object of the properties/values you want to animate
- `options` is an object representing the animation
  - `type` is the [animation type](#dynamics-and-properties): `dynamics.spring`, `dynamics.easeInOut`,... (default: `dynamics.easeInOut`)
  - `frequency`, `friction`, `bounciness`,... are specific to the animation type you are using
  - `duration` is in milliseconds (default: `1000`)
  - `delay` is in milliseconds (default: `0`)
  - `complete` (optional) is the completion callback
  - `change` (optional) is called at every change

### dynamics.stop(el)
Stops the animation applied on the element

### dynamics.css(el, properties)
This is applying the CSS properties to your element with the correct browser prefixes.
- `el` is a DOM element
- `properties` is an object of the CSS properties

### dynamics.setTimeout(fn, delay)
Dynamics.js has its own `setTimeout`. The reason is that `requestAnimationFrame` and `setTimeout` have different behaviors. In most browsers, `requestAnimationFrame` will not run in a background tab while `setTimeout` will. This can cause a lot of problems while using `setTimeout` along your animations. I suggest you use Dynamics's `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` to handle these scenarios.
- `fn` is the callback
- `delay` is in milliseconds

Returns a unique id

### dynamics.clearTimeout(id)
Clears a timeout that was defined earlier
- `id` is the timeout id

### dynamics.toggleSlow()
Toggle a debug mode to slow down every animations and timeouts.
This is useful for development mode to tweak your animation.
This can be activated using `Shift-Control-D` in the browser.

## Dynamics and properties
### dynamics.spring
- `frequency` default is 300
- `friction` default is 200
- `anticipationSize` (optional)
- `anticipationStrength` (optional)

### dynamics.bounce
- `frequency` default is 300
- `friction` default is 200

### dynamics.forceWithGravity and dynamics.gravity
- `bounciness` default is 400
- `elasticity` default is 200

### dynamics.easeInOut, dynamics.easeIn and dynamics.easeOut
- `friction` default is 500

### dynamics.linear
No properties

### dynamics.bezier
- `points` array of points and control points

The easiest way to output this kind of array is to use the [curve creator](http://dynamicsjs.com). Here is an example:
```javascript
[{"x":0,"y":0,"cp":[{"x":0.2,"y":0}]},
 {"x":0.5,"y":-0.4,"cp":[{"x":0.4,"y":-0.4},{"x":0.8,"y":-0.4}]},
 {"x":1,"y":1,"cp":[{"x":0.8,"y":1}]}]
```
