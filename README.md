A Real-Time news article streaming to your favorite NBA Team


Check it out: http://www.squadstream.com/#/


I've built the front end in React.js. 
 If that's you're thing I am looking forward to any contributions

``` 
    1. Fork
    2. Clone
    3. Npm install
    4. cd into directory
    5. run in terminal 
        a. npm start
    6. open localhost:8080
    7. Make changes (will update live :))
    8. npm run build (to check if working/ not neccessary)
    9. pull request (I think)
```

Plans for the future 

1. Add log-in/Authentication feature
2. Add a comment section for each article
